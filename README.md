Test1

One of the 2017 trends in technology is the rise of humanized digital technologies, able to travel with us wherever we go, across our multiple devices that we use every day, to connect us to the digital universe.

Voice, one of the most natural interface for humans is shaping intelligent personal assistants capable to have a conversation with us.

In this lab we’re going to bring to life an important skill for digital assistants: the capability to gather insights from the data stored in Adobe Analytics, and get answers to the questions that matter to us. During the lab we will use Alexa, Amazon’s digital assistant; we will train her to understand questions related to big data insights, then she will use Adobe Analytics to search for the information we want.
